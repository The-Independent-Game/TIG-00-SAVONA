ðŸŸ¡ TIG-00 SAVONA â€” The Simon Says reinvented by The Independent Game

TIG-00 is the first electronic game in the TIG collection: a maker-style reinterpretation of the classic Simon Says, designed to be built and customized.

ðŸŽ® What it is

Itâ€™s a light and sound memory game: the device shows a sequence of colors and sounds that the player must repeat correctly. Each turn adds a new step, making the challenge increasingly difficult.

ðŸ§© How itâ€™s made

TIG-00 SAVONA is fully open-source and 3D printable.
The electronics are based on an Arduino UNO R3 board, which controls:

4 buttons with integrated LEDs (red, green, blue and yellow)

1 piezo buzzer for sounds

1 LCD

The outer structure is modular and designed to integrate with other games in the TIG series: it uses the same base and some of the same components, helping to reduce costs and waste.
